# CS-210 Project One: Chada Tech Clock

# Project Summary
This project involved creating two clocks, one in 12-hour format and the other in 24-hour format, to meet the international standard ISO 8601 for Chada Tech. The primary goal was to allow users to view both clocks simultaneously and interact with the program to add hours, minutes, or seconds to the displayed time. This functionality was implemented using object-oriented programming principles in C++, focusing on modularity, clarity, and efficiency.

# What I Did Well
I believe I excelled in structuring the program in a modular way. By breaking down the functionality into clear, manageable functions, I ensured that the main() function remained concise and focused. This approach not only made the code more readable but also easier to maintain and debug.

# Areas for Enhancement
While the program meets the requirements, there is always room for improvement. For example, I could enhance the code by implementing more robust error handling to manage unexpected user inputs. This would make the program more secure and reliable, reducing the risk of crashes or incorrect behavior. Additionally, optimizing the way time is updated and displayed could improve the efficiency of the program, especially in scenarios with frequent user interaction.

# Challenges and Overcoming Them
One of the most challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that the time updates correctly across both clock formats simultaneously. To overcome this, I carefully designed the functions to handle time increments in a consistent manner and tested them thoroughly to confirm accuracy. Utilizing online resources and C++ documentation was instrumental in resolving any issues I encountered.

# Transferable Skills
The skills I developed during this project, particularly in modular programming and object-oriented design, are highly transferable to other projects. These principles are foundational in software development, ensuring that code is not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.

# Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure that the program is maintainable, I used clear and descriptive variable names, consistent formatting, and inline comments to explain the purpose of each function. This makes the code easier for others (or myself in the future) to understand and modify as needed. Additionally, by modularizing the code, it is adaptable to future enhancements, such as adding new features or adjusting the clock formats.
